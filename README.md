This is my humble effort to stay in touch with Android development, taking advantage of the challenge programm I thought it would be a nice practise for me to get a first hands on experience with compose. You can read more about this challenge [here](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/02/android-dev-challenge-lift-off-with.html).

## 

This is a mock UI application leveraging compose to create an application to adopt a puppy. ❤️

The application consists of two screens, one being the list of the pets and the second one a detail view for each of them that is accessed by clicking the elements of the first list.

This is far from being useful beyond the only experience of getting to know compose toolkit. This was the simplest project I could think of to start using it. If you are intested take a look at the code and feel free to add any issue or sugestions to it.

Thanks.
